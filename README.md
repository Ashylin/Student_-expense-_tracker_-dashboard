## Project Overview

This project is a Student Expense Tracker that analyzes personal spending data and visualizes insights using Power BI.

The workflow starts with Excel, where expense data is structured and calculated, and then moves to Power BI for interactive dashboards and analysis.

This project demonstrates my ability to:

Work with structured data

Build dashboards from scratch

Maintain continuity between Excel and Power BI

## Project Continuity

This Power BI dashboard is an extension of my earlier Excel project, where:

Total expenses were calculated

Category-wise totals were derived

Charts were created in Excel


Power BI was then used to create a more interactive and professional dashboard using the same data structure.
